Developed a web application that manages the Recipes and Shopping List using TypeScript, Angular 4. 
The application enables the user to add the recipes and shopping list dynamically and edit the existing recipes using forms and add the ingredients of interested recipe to the shopping list.
Used Google firebase for backend storage and authentication of the user for editing.
